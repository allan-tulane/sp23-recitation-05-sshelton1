- **1b.**
  Comparing the runtimes between the different algiorthms with both sorted and unsorted permutations did not seem to make a significant impact on runtime. I think this is the ideal case, and none of the algirithms seem to run signifcantly better for this case. However, the quicksort algorithm was consistantly significantly faster than the selection sort algorithm. The impact was especially noticible with lists of longer lengths. 

- **1c.**
  The timsort algorithm is significantly faster than the quicksort. It appears to be more consistant and has a much lower runtime especially for longer lists.
